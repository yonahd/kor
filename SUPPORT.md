## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I consider KorPro?

Consider KorPro if you:
- Want cost analysis and savings estimates for unused resources
- Prefer a zero-installation, cloud-based solution
- Manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across different cloud providers
- Need centralized visibility across GCP, AWS, and Azure
- Require health scores and efficiency metrics
- Need REST API access for automation and integration
- Want a modern web UI instead of CLI-only access

### Will open-source features be moved to KorPro?

**No.** We are committed to keeping all current open-source features free and available. The `all` command, resource detection, deletion capabilities, and other core CLI features will always remain open source. KorPro is a separate cloud-based platform that adds multi-cloud management, cost analysis, and advanced analytics on top of Kor's foundation.

### What's the difference between Kor and KorPro?

**Kor (Open Source):**
- CLI tool and kubectl plugin
- Requires local installation or in-cluster deployment
- Single cluster per run
- Manual configuration for each cluster
- Table, JSON, YAML output
- Free and open source

**KorPro:**
- Cloud-based SaaS platform
- Zero-installation (operates outside clusters)
- Unlimited clusters with auto-discovery
- Multi-cloud support (GCP, AWS, Azure)
- Web UI, REST API, CSV/PDF exports
- Cost analysis and health metrics
- Paid service with priority support

### Can I try KorPro before purchasing?

Yes! Contact us at [korpro.io/contact](https://korpro.io/contact). For custom enterprise evaluations, contact the team at [korpro.io/contact](https://korpro.io/contact).

### What happens if I need a feature that's only in KorPro?

If you encounter a limitation in the open-source version:
1. Open a GitHub Discussion to describe your use case
2. We'll help determine if it can be addressed with existing CLI features
3. If it requires KorPro capabilities (multi-cloud, cost analysis, etc.), we'll explain the options
4. You can decide whether to use KorPro or work within open-source constraints


We will never spam issues or PRs with "This is fixed in KorPro" messages. KorPro is mentioned only when directly relevant to a user's specific needs.

## Contributing to Open Source

The best way to improve Kor for everyone is to contribute! See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to get started. Contributions are always welcome, regardless of whether you're using the open-source CLI or KorPro.
